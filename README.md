Marlowe APM Visualization Tool
================

This is a [Sinatra app](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) used to present
page event data in different charts using [D3](http://d3js.org/).
It's meant to be a simple platform for exploring Application
Performance Management (APM) data with experimental visualizations and
animations.  I welcome contributions.

Requirements
---------------

1. Ruby 2.1.1
2. Smattering of ruby gems, including Sinatra, Rack

Running the Tool
----------------

1. git clone https://github.com/newrelic/marlowe.git
2. bundle install
3. rackup


Adding your own dataset
----------------
Just add json files to the data directory using the following format:

     [
     [ "timestamp", "transaction", "frontend", "backend"],
     [1368817694170, "Controller/applications/show", 2599.0, 1067.0],
     [1368817694231, "Controller/public_access/charts/show", 277.0, 166.0],
     [1368817694240, "Controller/applications/index", 1517.0, 983.0],
     [1368817694260, "Controller/traced_errors/index", 1188.0, 725.0],
     ....

The columns can be in any order, but must include `timestamp`, `transaction` and one of
`frontend` or `backend`.  They can include additional per-event dimensions which may be
utilized in some experiments as alternatives to `transaction`.

For details on the format, refer to the [readme.md](data/readme.md) file in the data directory.
